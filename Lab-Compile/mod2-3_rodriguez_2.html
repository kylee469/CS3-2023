		<p> My favorite anime is Howl's Moving Castle. It is all about an unconfident young woman cursed with an old body by a spiteful witch, her only chance of breaking the spell lies with a self-indulgent yet insecure young wizard and his companions in his legged, walking castle. It is a very comforting movie and I love the plot of the movie.
